# AlphaPEM

AlphaPEM is an open-source software package for simulating proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) systems for embedded applications. It is based on a physics-based, one-dimensional (1D), dynamic, two-phase, and non-isothermal model. It quickly simulates the internal states and voltage dynamics of PEMFC systems for all current densities and operating conditions imposed on it. In particular, it is possible to apply a step current density or use current profiles to generate polarization curves or electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) curves. It can also automatically calibrate the undetermined parameters of the model to simulate a given real fuel cell system.

A detailed [presentation](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2407.12373) of this program was published in the peer-reviewed journal SoftwareX. 

Improvements to **AlphaPEM**, such as the addition of heat transfer modelling and spatial extension to 1D+1D, will be available in the future.

Important note: AlphaPEM is an ongoing research project and is not a commercial product. Therefore, the latest online version may contain bugs, and not all features may be available. Relatively stable versions are listed in the [Major updates](#major-updates) section.

# Installation

To install **AlphaPEM**, follow these steps in a shell:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```git clone https://github.com/gassraphael/AlphaPEM.git```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```cd AlphaPEM```

3. Update the Python package manager, pip, to the latest available version:
    ```pip install --upgrade pip```

4. Install the required dependencies (eventually in a specific environment):
    ```
    pip install numpy scipy matplotlib colorama pygad
    python3 -m pip install git+https://github.com/RedFantom/ttkthemes
    ```
    

# Major updates

- V1.2 - in progress - This version of AlphaPEM includes: 
	- the addition of the MPL to the simulated cell, in both the anode and cathode. To ensure good numerical stability, a transition layer between each GDL and MPL is also included.
	- the addition of the open-source [ZSW GenStack](https://zenodo.org/records/14223364) as a calibrated fuel cell case study. 
- [V1.1](https://github.com/gassraphael/AlphaPEM/tree/11f07bd084a09cc6432f441b010d89d2a4229e4e) - 2025.08.18 - This version of AlphaPEM includes: 
	- the addition of heat transfer to the program, in cooperation with Pedro Affonso Nobrega (PERSEE, MINES PSL).
	- an improvement of the initial variable values: the algorithm waits for a given time (approximately 2 virtual hours) to reach equilibrium, and then the experiment starts (step/pola/EIS).
	- the limit liquid water saturation coefficient ($s_{lim}$) is temporarily removed for future refinement.
- [V1.0](https://github.com/gassraphael/AlphaPEM/tree/2b042c3d16d53fcd16779a5ffdc81eea75a9d012) - 2024.09.05 - This version of AlphaPEM corresponds to the one developed during RaphaÃ«l Gass's PhD from 2021 to 2024. 
	- It is based on a physics-based, one-dimensional (1D), dynamic, two-phase, and isothermal model.


# Work in progress

- The polarization curves from the EH-31 fuel cell example are no longer calibrated due to recent modifications made to the equations. A calibration of the undeterminate parameters will be performed in the future to correct this issue. If accurate examples are required, the [V1.0 version](https://github.com/gassraphael/AlphaPEM/tree/2b042c3d16d53fcd16779a5ffdc81eea75a9d012) of AlphaPEM can be used.
