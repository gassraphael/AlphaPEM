# AlphaPEM

AlphaPEM is an open-source software package for simulating proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) systems for embedded applications. It is based on a physics-based, one-dimensional (1D), dynamic, two-phase, and isothermal model. It can quickly simulate the internal states and voltage dynamics of PEMFC systems, and produce polarization and EIS curves. It can also automatically calibrate the undetermined parameters of the model to simulate a given real fuel cell system.

A detailed [presentation](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2407.12373) of this program was published in the peer-reviewed journal SoftwareX. 

Improvements to **AlphaPEM**, such as the addition of heat transfer modelling and spatial extension to 1D+1D, will be available in the future.
