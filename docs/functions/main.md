This file is designated for executing the AlphaPEM software package. Most of it should remain unaltered for regular program usage. 

In the section "AlphaPEM settings", users can select various preconfigured configurations for execution: the fuel cell, current density, auxiliary system, control strategy, purge, display and plot used. Adjustments to these configurations can be made within setting.py or current_densities.py and their associated files.
