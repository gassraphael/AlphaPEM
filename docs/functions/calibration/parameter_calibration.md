# Parameter Calibration

This file is designated for executing the undetermined parameters' calibration. Most of it should remain unaltered for regular program usage. 

Users can select here the fuel cell to calibrate, along with the undetermined parameters to modify, and the parameters for the Genetic Algorithm. The experimental fuel cell data are stored in the files calibration_modules.py and experimental_values.py.

The parameters employed for the Genetic Algorithm here have proven to be effective, though not necessarily optimal.
