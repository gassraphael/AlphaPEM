## Authors

- AlphaPEM is firstly developed by [Raphaël Gass](https://gassraphael.github.io/) during his PhD thesis in control engineering at the [LIS Laboratory](https://www.lis-lab.fr/) in [Aix-Marseille University](https://www.univ-amu.fr/), and in co-supervision with [FEMTO-ST Institute](https://www.femto-st.fr/en), within the [FCLab](https://www.fclab.fr/), in [Franche-Comté University](https://www.univ-fcomte.fr/), from 2021 to 2024. This work has been supervised by Prof. Zhongliang Li (FEMTO-ST), Prof. Rachid Outbib (LIS), Prof. Samir Jemei (FEMTO-ST) and Prof. Daniel Hissel (FEMTO-ST).

- The development of AlphaPEM was subsequently continued by Raphaël Gass during his postdoctoral research from 2025 to 2027 at [ENERGY-Lab](https://www.energylab.re/), [University of Reunion island](https://www.univ-reunion.fr/), in partnership with the [ZSW Institute](https://www.zsw-bw.de/) in Ulm, Germany. This work was supervised by Prof. Michel Benne (ENERGY-Lab), Associate Prof. Cédric Damour (ENERGY-Lab), Associate Prof. Dominique Grondin (ENERGY-Lab), and Dr. Florian Wilhelm (ZSW).
