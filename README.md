## Quickstart Guide

Here's a quick guide to get you started with **AlphaPEM**:

1. **Import the AlphaPEM module**:

    ```python
    from alphapem import AlphaPEM
    ```

2. **Initialize the model with your configuration**:

    ```python
    config = {
        'temperature': 353,  # in Kelvin
        'pressure': 101325,  # in Pascals
        'humidity': 0.8,     # relative humidity
        'current_density': 0.5  # in A/cm^2
    }
    model = AlphaPEM(config)
    ```

3. **Run the simulation**:

    ```python
    results = model.run()
    print(results)
    ```
